This is a Drupal distribution which can be used as a solid starting point for
building a site with Drupal 7. It is in use at loopduplicate.com.

Instead of using this distribution as a base distribution, it should be used
as an example of how to build your own distribution. It has a great set of
modules that are useful for many sites. Most settings can be overridden without
causing any features to be overridden.
