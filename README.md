This is a Drupal distribution which can be used as a solid starting point for
building a site with Drupal 7. It is in use at loopduplicate.com.

Instead of using this distribution as a base distribution, it should be used
as an example of how to build your own distribution. It has a great set of
modules that are useful for many sites. Most settings can be overridden without
causing any features to be overridden.

For a quick way to install from the command line, see the included document
at /scripts/development-scripts.txt

Currently, if this profile is installed using the UI instead of using drush, the
diff module and the save draft module output some error notices if error
reporting is turned on; they can all be ignored.
