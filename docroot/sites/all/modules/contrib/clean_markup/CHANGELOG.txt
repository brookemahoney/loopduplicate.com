Clean Markup 7.x-2.0, 2013-08-15
--------------------------------

* Added support for:
    * Panel panes

      By changing the pane style to "Clean markup" (click the gear in the top-
      right of a pane and click "Change" under "Style"), you can:

        * Disable or set the HTML5 element to use as the pane wrapper,
        * Enable or disable an inner div,
        * Add classes to the outer pane wrapper,
        * Add custom attributes (i.e. role="navigation")
        * Set the HTML5 element to wrap the title,
        * Toggle whether the block title is displayed visually,
        * Disable or set the HTML5 element to wrap the content.

    * Panel regions

        By changing the region style to "Clean markup" (click the gear in the
        top-left of a region and click "Change" under "Style"; or click "Display
        settings" on the panel itself), you can:

        * Disable or set the HTML5 element to use as the region wrapper,
        * Enable or disable an inner div,
        * Add classes to the outer region element,
        * Add custom attributes (i.e. role="navigation").
        * Enable or disable separator divs between panes in the region.

    * Panel Layouts

        Layouts have been provided to take advantage of Clean Markup's ability
        to output the minimal amount of markup.

        * One Column Clean: one region and single <section> wrapper.
        * One Column Reset: one region with no wrapper.
        * Six pack: six regions.
        * Myriad: five rows with four regions each that will output the absolute
          minimum markup. For example, a row with only one region will not
          output the row wrapper.
