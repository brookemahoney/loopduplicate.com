Table Element is a backport for Drupal 7 of the new Table element introduced in Drupal 8.

The table element is a "missing" form element supporting table rendering via the Form API. It includes table_select and draggable functionality.

The code for this module was originally written by @sun, and a similar version is available in his Edge project. This module is a simple backport from Issue #80855: "Add element #type table and merge tableselect/tabledrag into it"
