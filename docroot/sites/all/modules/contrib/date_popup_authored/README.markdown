## Acknowledgments

Date Popup Authored was inspired by the hacks provided by [brice][7] and [Rob Loach][8] in the Date module issue, "[Use Date Popup on 'Authored on' field][9]." It contains additional fixes to account for problems found in their solution, new configuration options, Drupal 7 support, and a full test suite.
