<p>CER's purpose is to keep reference fields synchronized with each other.
For example, if you have a node (&quot;Alice&quot;) with a user reference field,
and a user (&quot;Bob&quot;) with a node reference field, and you make Alice 
reference Bob, CER will automatically give Bob a back-reference to Alice. If 
Alice subsequently dereferences Bob, Bob will automatically deference Alice. 
Or, if Alice is deleted, Bob will lose his reference to Alice. CER does all
this transparently.</p>

<p>CER is a powerful module. It lets you create relationships between different
&quot;reference-type&quot; fields. A <dfn>reference-type</dfn> field is, simply,
any kind of field that references another entity. Out of the box, CER supports 
Entity  Reference, Node Reference, User Reference, and core Taxonomy Term 
Reference fields. It also includes a pair of add-on modules supporting Profile2
and Commerce Product Reference fields. CER also has an object-oriented plugin 
API that you can leverage if you need to support other types of reference 
fields or alter CER's behavior. (More information about CER's API 
can be found in cer.api.php.)</p>
